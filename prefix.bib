In this document we introduce Scan and describe step-by-step how it can be implemented efficiently in NVIDIA CUDA. We start with a basic na\"{\i}ve algorithm and proceed through more advanced techniques to obtain best performance. We then explain how to scan arrays of arbitrary size that cannot be processed with a single block of threads. Month},

@article{Gorlatch1999,
	Abstract = {Homomorphisms are functions that match the divide-and-conquer pattern and are widely used in parallel programming. Two problems are studied for homomorphisms on lists: 1. (1) parallelism extraction: finding a homomorphic representation of a given function; 2. (2) parallelism implementation: deriving an efficient parallel program that computes the function. The proposed approach to parallelism extraction starts by writing two sequential programs for the function, on traditional cons lists and on dual snoc lists; the parallel program is obtained by generalizing sequential programs as terms. For almost-homomorphic functions, e.g., the maximum segment sum problem, our method provides a systematic embedding into a homomorphism. The implementation problem is addressed by introducing the class of distributable homomorphisms and deriving for them a common parallel program schema. The derivation is based on equational reasoning in the Bird-Meertens formalism, which guarantees the correctness of the parallel target program. The approach is illustrated with the function scan (parallel prefix), for which the combination of our two systematic methods yields the optimal hypercube algorithm, usually presented ad hoc in the literature.},

The success of data parallel algorithms---even on problems that at first glance seem inherently serial---suggests that this style of programming has much wider applicability than was previously thought.},

	Abstract = {The scan primitives are powerful, general-purpose data-parallel primitives that are building blocks for a broad range of applications. We describe GPU implementations of these primitives, specifically an efficient formulation and implementation of segmented scan, on NVIDIA GPUs using the CUDA API. Using the scan primitives, we show novel GPU implementations of quicksort and sparse matrix-vector multiply, and analyze the performance of the scan primitives, several sort algorithms that use the scan primitives, and a graphical shallow-water fluid simulation using the scan framework for a tridiagonal matrix solver.},
